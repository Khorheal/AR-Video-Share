# AR-Video-Share
My Intern Project I developed for my internship at Doruk Otomasyon.

Main goal of this application is: sharing video feedback between two mobile devices 
And being able to show objects by drawing 3D annotations.

Sadly I cannot show any footage because I don't have a MAC PC and cannot build this, and I don't have any footage from my workplace
Though building this and using it is still viable.

I used GoogleAR framework through Unity.
This project is nowhere near finished. It only works on iOS devices and has multiple bugs.

Some finished products that I have gained inspiration for this project:
